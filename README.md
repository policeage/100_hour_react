<h3> Welcome to my new 100 Hour React Project <h3>

<p>I created a new 100 hour project because I was running in to limitations with my previous project due to EJS not being able to manipulate the DOM via press inputs, which is a feature found in React, the only method for me to update existing information within a page is via refreshing. This limitation would have lead to clunky interactions, with each new thing added to a list which would force the user to constantly refresh and send updates on their end, which would have also run in to limitations again on interactions with a database and eventually leading to a failure of a design.</p>
